# MultipleDXFExport
A simple DXF exporter for Fusion 360

Use: 

1. Clone the repo and place in the correct Scripts folder for your OS. If downloading the archive be sure to remove "-master" from the folder name.

    Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\Scripts`
    MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion 360/API/Scripts`

2. Start Fusion 360 and open a design with sketches you would like to save out as a DXF. Select all the sketches you would like to export at the same time.
3. Open the Scripts menu by clicking "ADD-INS" on the tool bar (MacOS: Shift+S). The script "MultipleDXFExport" should show up under "My Scripts".
4. Click Run and choose the output folder and clock Save. 

The original code this script is based on came from a post on the Autodesk Forum: [multiple DXF export](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-api-and-scripts/multiple-dxf-export/m-p/7548316#M5052).
